    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <button class="accordion">What is HIV?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>HIV infection is a slowly progressive infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. By
                multiplying, HIV affects not only the cells of the body, but also CD4 + T-lymphocytes, that is, the very
                cells that must fight the virus. When trying to get rid of the "enemy", the body independently activates
                the
                system of destruction of viruses, including the infected cells. And they immediately reproduce their
                offspring.</p>
        </div>

    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. HIV infection can develop asymptomatically in the
                human
                body over the long time - from 5 to 15 years. AIDS can be called the last stage of HIV. This is a
                serious
                condition caused by a prolonged course of HIV infection. If the cells of the immune system are destroyed
                to
                the limit, a person acquires various infectious and tumor diseases that cannot be cured. This is the
                main
                difference between HIV and AIDS. AIDS cannot be cured, but it can be avoided by detecting HIV infection
                in
                time and starting antiretroviral therapy that blocks the virus’s reproduction. Taking drugs, an
                HIV-positive
                person is not an AIDS patient. He/she is able to live as long as uninfected people, and also will not be
                dangerous for his/her sexual partner.</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <button class="accordion">What are the symptoms of HIV infection?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Symptoms specific to HIV do not exist. A couple of weeks after the virus penetrates, a person may have a
                fever, muscle and throat pain and other symptoms, such as the flu. After some time, the body will
                “adapt”
                and may not show signs of the virus at all.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <button class="accordion">How to understand that I have HIV?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Since HIV infection cannot be determined by symptoms, the only way to exclude or confirm it is to make a
                test.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div class="sections">
        <button class="accordion">What kind of HIV tests exist?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>HIV tests are divided into screening and confirmatory tests. According to the recommendations of the
                Ministry
                of Health, the initial analysis should be an Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) screening test. This method is not
                intended to detect the virus itself, but the antibodies that our immune system produces to combat it.
                The
                test allows you to identify antibodies to the virus of the first and second types (HIV-1 and HIV-2). If
                the
                result of the screening test is positive (i.e. antibodies are detected), a confirmatory test is made
                that
                determines the presence of the virus itself.</p>
            <p>As a sample of biological material for a screening test for antibodies, blood, blood plasma, or outer gum
                fluid (mouth fluid) can be used. The choice of biological material for the test does not affect the
                accuracy
                of the test.
            </p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">How does the OraQuick test work?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>HIV antibody test detects cells that the body's immune system creates in response to HIV infection. When
                HIV
                enters the body, the body begins to produce antibodies. In the case of HIV, antibodies cannot fight
                infection. But their presence can be used to say whether a person has HIV in the body. Most HIV tests
                detect
                antibodies to the infection, not the virus itself.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">How can a test work with saliva if HIV is not transmitted through saliva?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, HIV does not really spread through saliva. But the OraQuick test does not detect the virus itself,
                but
                antibodies produced by the body in response to the virus.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">Does the test reflect the presence of HIV infection at the time of infection?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Screening tests for antibodies of the latest generation (OraQuick refers to them) can detect antibodies
                to
                HIV of Type 1 and Type 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), which appear in the body 3-6 months after the infection. At
                an
                earlier stage, laboratory blood tests can detect the virus.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">Should I be afraid of HIV-infected people?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>HIV is not considered the most contagious virus. For example, saliva, sweat and urine do not contain
                enough
                virus to infect, i.e., HIV is not transmitted by contact with these fluids or through the air. Typical
                ways
                of infection are unprotected penetrating sexual contact, the sharing of non-sterile equipment for
                injections, tattoos or piercings, and the use of non-sterile medical and cosmetic instruments. In
                addition,
                the virus can be transmitted from an HIV-infected mother to her child.</p></div>

    <div>
        <button class="accordion">What is hepatitis C?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>This is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus. Being the most serious type of liver infection,
                without timely treatment, it develops into liver fibrosis, then into cirrhosis or cancer. Currently,
                there
                is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but if the virus is detected at the initial stage, antiviral drugs can
                save a
                person’s life.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between HIV and Hepatitis C?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Hepatitis C affects the human liver, and HIV affects an immune system. HIV infection can be transmitted
                both
                through the blood and through other human biological fluids, such as the breast milk. Infection with
                Hepatitis C occurs only through the blood. Most often, infection occurs through the sharing of injection
                tools, the use of non-sterile medical and cosmetic tools, the transfusion of unverified blood or blood
                products, and sexual relationship that leads to contact with blood. The similarity of viruses is that
                both
                of them practically do not manifest themselves after infection. Without realizing his/her positive
                status, a
                person does not start treatment on time, which leads to fatal consequences.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Hepatitis C virus can cause both acute and chronic illness. During the acute human hepatitis, pain in the
                abdominal cavity can disturb, sometimes nausea and vomiting occur, the temperature rises and other
                symptoms
                appear which a person cannot always associate with a specific disease. However, such hepatitis can
                disappear
                spontaneously even without treatment, while chronic hepatitis can be asymptomatic for many years. Its
                danger
                is that if a person does not know about the virus, then when the symptoms finally appear, it will be too
                late to treat the disease.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">How to understand that I have hepatitis C?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The World Health Organization recommends that every adult check for the presence of the virus in the body
                for
                preventive purposes, regardless of whether the person is at risk. If the test shows the presence of
                antibodies to the virus, a confirmation test should be done at the laboratory. PCR test (Polymerase
                Chain
                Reaction) detects the presence of the virus in the body at the moment. A biochemical blood test can
                evaluate
                the functionality of the liver. A liver biopsy gives information about the degree of organ damage and
                allows
                you to choose an individual treatment.</p></div>

    </div>
    <div>
        <button class="accordion">Should I be Wary of Hepatitis C Patients?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>As in case of HIV, there are far more people infected with hepatitis worldwide than we can imagine.
                Including
                because many people themselves do not know that they are carriers of the virus. Hepatitis C is not
                transmitted through the breast milk, food, water, or through contacts such as hugs, kisses, or sharing
                food
                and drinks. It turns out that ordinary household contacts with infected people do not need to be
                avoided,
                since only direct contacts with blood are dangerous.</p></div>
